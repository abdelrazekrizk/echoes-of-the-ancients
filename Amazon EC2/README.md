## Amazon EC2 Instance for "Echoes of the Ancients"

"Echoes of the Ancients" (`game.py`) is deployed and running on an Amazon EC2 instance. <p>EC2 provides virtual servers in the cloud, giving you control over the operating system and environment.

**Key Functions:**

*   **Hosting the Game Application:** The EC2 instance hosts the `game.py` script and all its dependencies.
*   **Environment Management:** You have full control over the operating system, installed software, and configurations on the EC2 instance.
*   **Direct Access:** You can directly access the EC2 instance via SSH for maintenance, updates, and troubleshooting.

**Creating and Configuring an EC2 Instance:**

1.  **Launch Instance:** In the EC2 console, click "Launch Instances."
2.  **Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI):** Select an appropriate AMI (operating system). For a Python application, an Amazon Linux or Ubuntu AMI is a good choice.
3.  **Instance Type:** Choose an instance type based on your resource requirements (CPU, memory). For a text-based adventure, a `t2.micro` or `t3.micro` instance is likely sufficient for initial development.
4.  **Key Pair:** Select or create a key pair. This is essential for securely connecting to your instance via SSH.
5.  **Network Settings:** Configure network settings, including security groups (firewalls) to allow traffic on necessary ports (e.g., port 22 for SSH, and any ports you use for your game if it has a network interface).
6.  **Storage:** Configure storage for your instance. The default storage is usually sufficient for a small application.
7.  **Advanced Details:** You can configure additional details, such as IAM roles (for the instance to access other AWS services). It is highly recommended to create an IAM role with only the necessary permissions for your application and attach it to the EC2 instance.
8.  **Review and Launch:** Review your configuration and launch the instance.

**Setting up the Game on EC2:**

1.  **Connect to the Instance:** Connect to your EC2 instance using SSH with the key pair you selected.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Install Python and any required Python packages (e.g., `boto3`, `playsound`, `python-dotenv`) using `pip`.
3.  **Transfer the Game Code:** Transfer your `game.py` script and any other necessary files to the EC2 instance.  You can use `scp` or `sftp` for this.
4.  **Configure Environment Variables:** Set up your environment variables (AWS credentials, region, etc.) either directly in the shell or using a `.env` file and the `python-dotenv` library.  Remember to use AWS IAM Identity Center for local development, as described in the previous sections.
5.  **Run the Game:** Run your `game.py` script. You may want to use a process manager like `tmux` or `screen` to keep the game running even if you disconnect from SSH.

**Advantages of EC2:**

*   **Simplicity (Initially):**  Setting up a single EC2 instance can be relatively straightforward, especially for small projects.
*   **Direct Control:** You have complete control over the server environment.

**Disadvantages of EC2:**

*   **Management Overhead:** You are responsible for OS patching, security updates, and server maintenance.
*   **Scalability Challenges:** Scaling up requires manually provisioning more EC2 instances.
*   **Resource Utilization:** EC2 instances might be over-provisioned, leading to wasted resources and costs.
*   **Deployment Complexity:** Updating the game requires manual intervention on the EC2 instance.

**Future Enhancements: Containerization (ECS)**

Migrating to Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is strongly recommended for the future.  Containerization offers several significant advantages:

*   **Simplified Deployment:** Deploying updates becomes much easier. You build a new container image and deploy it to ECS. ECS handles the rest.
*   **Scalability:** ECS makes scaling your game much easier. You can configure it to automatically scale up or down based on demand.
*   **Resource Efficiency:** Containers allow you to pack your application more densely onto the underlying infrastructure, potentially saving costs.
*   **Portability:** Container images are portable. You can run them on different environments (local development, EC2, Fargate).
*   **Isolation:** Containers provide isolation between your game and the underlying host system. This improves security and stability.
