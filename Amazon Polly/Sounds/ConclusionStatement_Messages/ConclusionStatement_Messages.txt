I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Can you please rephrase your request?

I didn't understand what you said. You can try asking about your quests, inventory, or actions you want to take.


Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Could you please try again or ask for help with something else?


Iâ€™m not sure how to respond to that. You can say things like 'move north' or 'take the key' for better results.


It seems I missed that. Please tell me what you want in a different way. For example, you can ask about locations or items.
